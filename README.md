### Neuing

Work in progress neural network being written from scratch in Golang. No external libraries used for the neural network and all the math revolving it.

### Usage

```bash
go run main.go
```

### TODO
- [x] Basic Neurons
- [x] Layers
- [x] Activation Functions
- [x] Loss Functions
- [x] Backpropagation
- [x] Optimization
- [x] Regularization
  - [x] L1 and L2 Regularization
  - [x] Dropout
- [ ] Regression
- [ ] Data
  - [ ] Loading Data
  - [ ] Validating Data
  - [ ] Training On the Data
- [ ] Model Evaluation
- [ ] Prediction

### Fixes
- [x] Rewrite Loss as a Type
- [x] Split Code Into Modules
- [ ] Fix the backpropagation
