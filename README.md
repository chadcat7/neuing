### Neuing

Work in progress neural network being written from scratch in Golang. No external libraries used for the neural network and all the math revolving it, thought I may add some gui to it?

### Usage

```bash
go run src/main.go
```

### TODO
- [x] Basic Neurons
- [x] Layers
- [x] Activation Functions
- [x] Loss Functions
- [x] Backpropagation
- [x] Optimization
- [ ] Data
  - [ ] Loading Data
  - [ ] Validating Data
  - [ ] Training On the Data
- [ ] Regularization
- [ ] Model Evaluation
- [ ] Prediction
- [ ] Possible GUI?

### Fixes
- [x] Rewrite Loss as a Type
- [x] Split Code Into Modules
- [ ] Fix the backpropagation
